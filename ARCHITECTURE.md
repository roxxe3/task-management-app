# Architecture Documentation

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Frontend
- **React + Vite**: Chosen for its fast development experience, HMR capabilities, and optimized build output
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- **@hello-pangea/dnd**: Robust drag-and-drop library for smooth task reordering
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with modern features

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express**: Provides a lightweight, flexible backend with excellent npm ecosystem support
- **Supabase**: Offers a powerful combination of:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Built-in authentication
  - Row Level Security
  - Environment Configuration:
    ```env
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
    PORT=3000
    ```

## Database Setup
For database setup instructions, please refer to the [README.md](./README.md#setup-instructions) file.

## Database Schema

Refer to the `backend/database-setup.sql` file for the complete database schema.

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Utilizes JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing and storage

### Authorization
- API endpoint validation using middleware

### Data Protection
- Basic input validation on backend
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- Simple CORS configuration for API security

## State Management
- Uses React's built-in hooks for local state
- Context API for global state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Planned Enhancements

#### Database
- ðŸš§ Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- ðŸš§ Connection pooling for better resource utilization

#### Frontend
- ðŸš§ Code splitting for optimized loading
- ðŸš§ Lazy loading of components
- ðŸš§ Memoization of expensive computations
- ðŸš§ Debounced search inputs
- ðŸš§ Virtualized lists for large datasets

#### API
- ðŸš§ Request caching implementation
- ðŸš§ Rate limiting implementation
- ðŸš§ Compression middleware
- ðŸš§ Advanced error handling

#### General
- ðŸš§ TypeScript migration
- ðŸš§ Testing setup (unit, integration, E2E)
- ðŸš§ CI/CD pipeline
- ðŸš§ Deployment automation

## Error Handling
- Basic error handling middleware
- Simple error logging with console

## Testing Strategy
Currently not implemented. Future plans include:
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Deployment Architecture
Currently manual deployment. Future plans include:
- Frontend hosted on CDN for global availability
- Backend deployed on scalable infrastructure
- Database backups and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Future Considerations
1. Implementing WebSocket for real-time collaboration
2. Adding offline support with Service Workers
3. Implementing file attachments for tasks
4. Adding team collaboration features
5. Implementing activity logging and analytics
6. Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
