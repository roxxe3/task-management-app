# Architecture Documentation

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Frontend
- **React + Vite**: Chosen for its fast development experience, HMR capabilities, and optimized build output
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- **@hello-pangea/dnd**: Robust drag-and-drop library for smooth task reordering
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with modern features and TypeScript support

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express**: Provides a lightweight, flexible backend with excellent npm ecosystem support
- **Supabase**: Offers a powerful combination of:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Built-in authentication
  - Row Level Security
  - Real-time capabilities
  - Automatic API generation
  - Environment Configuration:
    ```env
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
    PORT=3000
    ```

## Database Setup
For database setup instructions, please refer to the [README.md](./README.md#setup-instructions) file.

## Database Schema

Refer to the `backend/database-setup.sql` file for the complete database schema.

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Utilizes Supabase Auth for secure user management
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Social auth providers support (if needed)

### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Database-level security policies prevent unauthorized access
- API endpoint validation using middleware

### Data Protection
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CORS configuration for API security

## State Management
- Uses React's built-in hooks for local state
- Context API for global state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Efficient joins and query optimization
- Connection pooling for better resource utilization

### Frontend
- Code splitting for optimized loading
- Lazy loading of components
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Debounced search inputs
- Virtualized lists for large datasets

### API
- Request caching
- Rate limiting
- Compression middleware
- Efficient error handling

## Error Handling
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Custom error classes for different scenarios
- Proper error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Continuous Integration setup

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend hosted on CDN for global availability
- Backend deployed on scalable infrastructure
- Database backups and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Future Considerations
1. Implementing WebSocket for real-time collaboration
2. Adding offline support with Service Workers
3. Implementing file attachments for tasks
4. Adding team collaboration features
5. Implementing activity logging and analytics
