# Task Management App Structure

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React and follows a component-based architecture:

### Core Components
- [App.jsx](mdc:task-app-frontend/src/App.jsx) - Main application component and routing
- [Header.jsx](mdc:task-app-frontend/src/components/Header.jsx) - App header with logo and date
- [TaskProgress.jsx](mdc:task-app-frontend/src/components/TaskProgress.jsx) - Circular progress indicator
- [CategoryFilter.jsx](mdc:task-app-frontend/src/components/CategoryFilter.jsx) - Horizontal scrollable category filter

### Design Patterns
1. Component Organization:
   - Components are kept focused and under 200 lines
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Shared logic is extracted into hooks

2. Styling:
   - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Dark theme with accent color #caff17
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Custom animations and transitions

3. State Management:
   - React hooks for local state
   - Props for component communication
   - Context for global state (auth, themes)

### Code Standards
- No unnecessary comments
- Clear component and function naming
- Consistent file structure
- Proper error handling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance optimizations
